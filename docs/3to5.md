This document describes the breaking changes brought by upgrading alibabacloud-tairjedis-sdk from version 3.x to version 5.x.

1. This upgrade changes the underlying dependency from [Jedis](https://github.com/redis/jedis) to [Valkey-Java](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-java), which is a replacement from Jedis Fork. Therefore, you need to change `redis.clients.jedis.` to `io.valkey.`

2. Since Jedis [4.x](https://github.com/redis/jedis/blob/master/docs/3to4.md) and [5.x](https://github.com/redis/jedis/blob/master/docs/breaking-5.md) bring many incompatible upgrades, Valkey-java comes from Jedis Fork, you may need to change the return value of some APIs, see the document for details.

3. Because the new version of Valkey-java has deleted these classes, you need to modify the import path.
- `import redis.clients.jedis.ScanParams;` to `import com.aliyun.tair.jedis3.ScanParams;`
- `import redis.clients.jedis.ScanResult;` to `import com.aliyun.tair.jedis3.ScanResult;`
- `import redis.clients.jedis.GeoUnit;` to `import redis.clients.jedis.args.GeoUnit;`
- `import redis.clients.jedis.params.Params;` to `import com.aliyun.tair.jedis3.Params;`

4. Some methods deleted by Jedis need to use Jedis3BuilderFactory.
- `BuilderFactory.BYTE_ARRAY_MAP` to `Jedis3BuilderFactory.BYTE_ARRAY_MAP`

5. The usage of Pipeline has changed.

The original one is as follows:
```java
TairHashPipeline pipeline = new TairHashPipeline();
    pipeline.setClient(jedis.getClient());
    pipeline.set("xx", "yy");
    pipeline.sync();
```
The new one is as follows:
```java
TairHashPipeline pipeline = new TairHashPipeline(jedis);
    pipeline.set("xx", "yy");
    pipeline.sync();
```
